## 👋 hey!

This is my portfolio. Built it myself to practice HTML/CSS/JS.

**No templates. No frameworks. No fake blockchain AI startup energy.**

Just me learning stuff and putting it online.

## 🧠 why this exists

Started coding because I was curious how computers work.

Still curious. Still learning.

This repo will look completely different in 6 months. That's the goal.
